[entity-name]
rabbasca-warp-stabilizer=Warp-field stabilizer
rabbasca-warp-tech-analyzer=Warp core analyzer

[entity-description]
rabbasca-warp-stabilizer=A true marvel of rabbascan engineering that passively stabilizes the warp field used by itself and [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to perform interplanetary operations. Requires huge amounts of power to operate.

rabbasca-coordinate-calibrations=Disruption-proof coordinate-system
rabbasca-holmium-coating=Quantum foam encapsulation device
rabbasca-change-affinity=Change stabilizer attunement
rabbasca-stabilize-warpfield=Stabilize the local warp-field

[item-description]
rabbasca-locate-stabilizer=Has a roughly 20% chance to locate a stabilizer. Will otherwise always create [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] next to an existing stabilizer.
rabbasca-warp-matrix=Quickly dissolves when removed from a stabilizer, stabilizing the local warp field. Once fully stabilized, [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] will warp itself and its surroundings to another location to stabilize.

[recipe-name]
rabbasca-change-affinity=Attune to __1__
rabbasca-attuned-materialize=Materialize __1__

[recipe-description]
rabbasca-locate-stabilizer=Instruct the vault to locate a [space-location=rabbasca-underground]. This may take multiple attempts.\nCrafting this with a stabilizer located will create a [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] next to it and de-select this recipe.
rabbasca-change-affinity=[entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] can use [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] to warp in items from the attuned location. [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] can only be attuned to one location at the same time.
rabbasca-attuned-materialize=Requires [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] attuned to [space-location=__1__]. Uses [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] to locate matter somewhere on [space-location=__1__].\n\n(This does not involve [virtual-signal=rabbasca-warp-inventory])

[technology-description]
rabbasca-underground=Locate [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] to gain access to even stronger warp technologies.\nMust be ressearched again if you somehow lose access to the last located stabilizer.
rabbasca-warp-prep=Depending on where [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] currently is, you have access to different gases in the atmosphere, nearby liquid, and specific recipes available in [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon]. Check the top-left bar to see what is currently available.

[space-location-name]
rabbasca-underground=__ENTITY__rabbasca-warp-stabilizer__ Site

[space-location-description]
rabbasca-underground=A location close to [planet=rabbasca]'s core, protected by [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer]. Use [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to establish a factory here and make use of the stabilizer's powers.\nIf [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] is destroyed, the whole location will be destroyed with it, requiring you to locate a new one.

rabbasca-underground-briefing=Accessing the __ENTITY__rabbasca-warp-stabilizer__

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
rabbasca-underground-briefing=Rabbascan archives contain information abount [space-location=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] which help in making warp-tech possible. They frequently change places, but will always be somewhere close to the core of a planet. While you cannot visit this place yourself and supply via space platforms is unavailable, remote management via [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] is possible.\n\nThe stabilizer has a huge passive power draw. Usage of machines with [item=harene-ears-core] and [entity=burner-mining-drill] is required to get started, but restoring power using generators is also an option.\nIt also requires [fluid=harene] to operate and will not stop working once restarted. Its reserves are running low and you will have to combine the resources gathered from the locations it will visit to set up a sustainable [fluid=harene] production before fuel runs out. Otherwise it will be stranded in one location and you might need to abandon it...
