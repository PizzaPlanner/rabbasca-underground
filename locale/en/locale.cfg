[entity-description]
rabbasca-warp-stabilizer=A true marvel of rabbascan engineering that passively stabilizes the warp field used by itself and [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to perform interplanetary operations. Requires huge amounts of power to operate.
rabbasca-stabilizer-consumer=Constantly harvests [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly] to fuel [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer]. Can not be stopped once started by [technology=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer].\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-alert] Wasting too much [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] might cause a fuel shortage, leaving the stabilizer unable to warp to any new location
rabbasca-warp-anomaly=Will automatically be extracted by [entity=rabbasca-stabilizer-consumer] to power [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer].\nWhen [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] changes location, each anomaly has a small chance to manifest into temporary resources native to the new location (see [tip=rabbasca-manifest-anomaly]).\nAnomalies never spawn on [tile=rabbasca-underground-rubble-powered].

rabbasca-spacetime-sensor=Spacetime fluctuation sensor
rabbasca-coordinate-system=Disruption-proof coordinate-system
rabbasca-quantum-device=Quantum foam encapsulation device
rabbasca-stabilize-warpfield=Stabilize the local warp-field

[item-description]
rabbasca-locate-stabilizer=Has a roughly 20% chance to locate a stabilizer. Will otherwise always create [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] next to an existing stabilizer.
rabbasca-warp-matrix=A byproduct of warp-field stabilization. Used for research and by [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to warp in matter from the planet [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] is currently on.

[recipe-name]
rabbasca-local-materialize=Materialize __1__
rabbasca-lithium-amide-fission=Lithium amide fission
rabbasca-underground-extract-atmosphere=Extract __1__ from atmosphere
rabbasca-amplify-anomaly=Anomaly amplification

[recipe-description]
rabbasca-locate-stabilizer=Instruct the vault to locate a [space-location=rabbasca-underground]. This may take multiple attempts.\nCrafting this with a stabilizer located will create a [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] next to it and de-select this recipe.
rabbasca-local-materialize=Requires [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] on [space-location=__1__]. Uses [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] to rematerialize matter over a short distance.\n\n(This does not involve [virtual-signal=rabbasca-warp-inventory])
rabbasca-stabilizer-consumer=Restarts [entity=rabbasca-stabilizer-consumer], which will constantly harvest [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] to fuel [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer]. It will run continuously, even when the stabilizer is paused. 
rabbasca-amplify-anomaly=When [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilzer] changes location while this recipe is crafting, there is a chance for an anomaly to manifest at the crafter's location (see [tip=rabbasca-manifest-anomaly]). This can cause resources to spawn on top of [tile=rabbasca-underground-rubble-powered] to establish permanent mining sites.

[technology-description]
rabbasca-warp-stabilizer=Resume stabilizing operations by activating [entity=rabbasca-stabilizer-consumer], allowing [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] to warp to different locations by [recipe=rabbasca-stabilize-warpfield]
rabbasca-warp-prep=Depending on where [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] currently is, you have access to different gases in the atmosphere, nearby liquid, and specific recipes available in [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon]. Check the top-left bar to see what is currently available.
rabbasca-total-recall=Whenever any your structures would be left behind by [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer], either when built in an unsafe location, or when abandoning the stabilizer, they will be recalled into [virtual-signal=rabbasca-warp-inventory] instead, as long as there is room available.
rabbasca-amplify-anomaly=Make anomalies manifest on [tile=rabbasca-underground-rubble-powered], enabling mining sites that can follow [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizers] to new locations.

[space-location-description]
rabbasca-underground=A location close to [planet=rabbasca]'s core, protected by [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer]. Use [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to establish a factory here and make use of the stabilizer's powers.\nIf [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] is destroyed, the whole location will be destroyed with it, requiring you to locate a new one.

rabbasca-manifest-anomaly=Anomaly manifestation

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
rabbasca-underground-briefing=Rabbascan archives contain information about [space-location=rabbasca-underground] which help in making warp-tech possible. They frequently change places, but will always be somewhere close to the core of a planet. While you cannot visit these places yourself and supply via space platforms is unavailable, after locating one with [recipe=rabbasca-locate-stabilizer], remote management via [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] is possible.\n\nStabilzers have a huge passive power draw. Machines with [item=harene-ears-core] and [entity=burner-mining-drill] can get you started, restoring power using generators is an option with the basics established.\nThey also require [fluid=harene] to operate, producing quickly-dissolving [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] as a byproduct. With reserves running low, you will have to combine the resources gathered from the different warp locations to set up a sustainable production chain before fuel runs out. This might require multiple attempts, as an unfuelled stabilizer can no longer warp to other places, leaving you unable to produce more [fluid=harene] to fuel it. But you can always start fresh by abandoning it and locating a new stabilizer. Just make sure to warp your factory to safety before doing so...
rabbasca-manifest-anomaly=[entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] warps between locations to repair [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly]. A new set of anomalies will be found at each location. The stabilizer estimates its progress and usually leaves a location before all anomalies have been repaired. \n\nOn location change, anomalies can manifest into resources or other materials by two means:\n- Each remaining [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly] has a chance to manifest itself\n- Each [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] crafting [recipe=rabbasca-amplify-anomaly] has a chance to manifest a new anomaly below itself\n\nThe chance scales with the [color=purple]amount[/color] of [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] present inside [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly]/[entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon]([color=yellow]entity[/color]) during the location change.\nThe type of created [color=#00ffff]material[/color] depends on which planet the new location is on and each material has a different [color=orange]base chance[/color].\n[item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] inside [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] also scales higher than in [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly] by a factor of 3.\nOr as formula:\nfor [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly]: \n  Chance per [color=yellow]entity[/color] to manifest into [color=#00ffff]material[/color] = [color=orange]base chance[/color] of [color=#00ffff]material[/color] * [color=purple]amount[/color] in [color=yellow]entity[/color]\nfor [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] crafting [recipe=rabbasca-amplify-anomaly]: \n  Chance per [color=yellow]entity[/color] to manifest into [color=#00ffff]material[/color] = [color=orange]base chance[/color] of [color=#00ffff]material[/color] * [color=purple]amount[/color] in [color=yellow]entity[/color] * 3\n\nNote that the chance for [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] with no [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] in its inventory will be 0 regardless of it crafting the correct recipe, same as fully depleted [entity=rabbasca-warp-anomaly].
