rabbasca-warp-tech-analyzer=Warp core analyzer

[entity-description]
rabbasca-warp-stabilizer=A true marvel of rabbascan engineering that passively stabilizes the warp field used by itself and [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to perform interplanetary operations. Requires huge amounts of power to operate.

rabbasca-quantum-device=Quantum foam encapsulation device
rabbasca-stabilize-warpfield=Stabilize the local warp-field

[item-description]
rabbasca-locate-stabilizer=Has a roughly 20% chance to locate a stabilizer. Will otherwise always create [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] next to an existing stabilizer.
rabbasca-warp-matrix=Quickly dissolves when removed from a stabilizer, stabilizing the local warp field. Once fully stabilized, [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] will warp itself and its surroundings to another location to stabilize.

[recipe-name]
rabbasca-change-affinity=Attune to __1__
rabbasca-attuned-materialize=Materialize __1__

[recipe-description]
rabbasca-locate-stabilizer=Instruct the vault to locate a [space-location=rabbasca-underground]. This may take multiple attempts.\nCrafting this with a stabilizer located will create a [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] next to it and de-select this recipe.
rabbasca-change-affinity=[entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] can use [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] to warp in items from the attuned location. [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] can only be attuned to one location at the same time.
rabbasca-attuned-materialize=Requires [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] attuned to [space-location=__1__]. Uses [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] to locate matter somewhere on [space-location=__1__].\n\n(This does not involve [virtual-signal=rabbasca-warp-inventory])

[technology-description]
rabbasca-warp-stabilizer=[entity=rabbasca-vault-crafter] can locate [space-location=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer]. Studying it may provide insight into even stronger warp technologies.
rabbasca-warp-prep=Depending on where [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] currently is, you have access to different gases in the atmosphere, nearby liquid, and specific recipes available in [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon]. Check the top-left bar to see what is currently available.

[space-location-name]
rabbasca-underground=__ENTITY__rabbasca-warp-stabilizer__ Site

[space-location-description]
rabbasca-underground=A location close to [planet=rabbasca]'s core, protected by [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer]. Use [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] to establish a factory here and make use of the stabilizer's powers.\nIf [entity=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] is destroyed, the whole location will be destroyed with it, requiring you to locate a new one.

[tips-and-tricks-item-name]
rabbasca-underground-briefing=Accessing the __ENTITY__rabbasca-warp-stabilizer__

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
rabbasca-underground-briefing=Rabbascan archives contain information abount [space-location=rabbasca-warp-stabilizer] which help in making warp-tech possible. They frequently change places, but will always be somewhere close to the core of a planet. While you cannot visit these places yourself and supply via space platforms is unavailable, remote management via [entity=rabbasca-warp-pylon] is possible.\n\nThe stabilizer has a huge passive power draw. Machines with [item=harene-ears-core] and [entity=burner-mining-drill] can get you started, restoring power using generators is an option with the basics established.\nThe stabilizer also requires [fluid=harene] to operate, producing quickly-dissolving [item=rabbasca-warp-matrix] as a byproduct. Its reserves are running low though, and you will have to combine the resources gathered from the locations it will visit to set up a sustainable production chain before fuel runs out. There is a possibility of it getting stranded in one location, leaving you unable to produce more [fluid=harene] to fuel it. But you can always start fresh by abandoning it and locating a new stabilizer. Just make sure to warp your factory to safety before doing so...
